# :racing_car: The-Ultimate-F1-Quiz

The Ultimate F1 Quiz is a simplistic and fun trivia game that mimics the progression of a real F1 weekend. You start with free practice, then prepare for race day with a qualifying session, and finally use the pit stops you have earned to complete as many laps as possible on race day. Anyone can try it with the link below!
